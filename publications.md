A supertranslation algebra is a Z-graded Lie superalgebra $\\mathfrak{m}=\\mathfrak{m}_{-2}+\\mathfrak{m}_{-1}=V+(S+...+S)$ whose bracket $[.,.]|_{\\mathfrak{m}_{-1}\\otimes \\mathfrak{m}_{-1}}$ is $\\mathfrak{so}(V)$-invariant and non-degenerate. We consider the maximal transitive prolongations in the sense of Tanaka of supertranslation algebras. We prove that they are finite-dimensional for $\\dim V\\geq 3$ and classify them in terms of super-Poincaré algebras and appropriate $\\Bbb Z$-gradations of simple Lie superalgebras.","archiveprefix":"arXiv","arxivid":"1212.1826","author":[{"family":"Altomani","given":"A."},{"family":"Santi","given":"A."}],"eprint":"1212.1826","keywords":"Mathematical Physics,Rings and Algebras","page":"1-25","title":"Classification of maximal transitive prolongations of super-Poincaré algebras","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1826","id":"Altomani2012","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12]]}}]
