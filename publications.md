- abstract: Let $V$ be a complex orthogonal vector space and $S$ an irreducible $C\!\ell(V)$-module.
    A supertranslation algebra is a Z-graded Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{m}=\mathfrak{m}_{-2}+\mathfrak{m}_{-1}=V+(S+...+S)$
    whose bracket $[.,.]|_{\mathfrak{m}_{-1}\otimes \mathfrak{m}_{-1}}$ is $\mathfrak{so}(V)$-invariant
    and non-degenerate. We consider the maximal transitive prolongations in the sense
    of Tanaka of supertranslation algebras. We prove that they are finite-dimensional
    for $\dim V\geq 3$ and classify them in terms of super-Poincaré algebras and appropriate
    $\Bbb Z$-gradations of simple Lie superalgebras.

- abstract: We consider isometric immersions in arbitrary codimension of three-dimensional
    strongly pseudoconvex pseudo-hermitian CR manifolds into the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$
    and generalize in a natural way the notion of associated family. We show that
    the existence of such deformations turns out to be very restrictive and we give
    a complete classification.

- abstract: ! 'Let $(V,(.,.))$ be a pseudo-Euclidean vector space and $S$ an irreducible
    $C\!\ell(V)$-module. An extended translation algebra is a graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak{m}=\mathfrak{m}_{-2}+\mathfrak{m}_{-1}=V+S$
    with bracket given by $([s,t],v) = \beta(v\cdot s,t)$ for some nondegenerate $\mathfrak{so}(V)$-invariant
    reflexive bilinear form $\beta$ on $S$. An extended Poincaré structure on a manifold
    $M$ is a regular distribution $\mathcal D$ of depth 2 whose Levi form $L_x: \mathcal
    D_x\wedge\mathcal D_x\rightarrow T_xM/\mathcal D_x$ at any point $x\in M$ is identifiable
    with the bracket $[.,.]: S\wedge S\rightarrow V$ of a fixed extended translation
    algebra $\mathfrak m$. The classification of the standard maximally homogeneous
    manifolds with an extended Poincaré structure is given, in terms of Tanaka prolongations
    of extended translation algebras and of appropriate gradations of real simple
    Lie algebras.'

- abstract: Using a bigraded differential complex depending on the CR and pseudohermitian
    structure, we give a characterization of three-dimensional strongly pseudoconvex
    pseudo-hermitian CR-manifolds isometrically immersed in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$
    in terms of an integral representation of Weierstrass type. Restricting to the
    case of immersions in $\mathbb{R}^4$, we study harmonicity conditions for such
    immersions and give a complete classification of CR-pluriharmonic immersions.

- abstract: We consider a class of compact homogeneous CR manifolds, that we call
    $\mathfrak n$-reductive, which includes the orbits of minimal dimension of a compact
    Lie group $K_0$ in an algebraic homogeneous variety of its complexification $K$.
    For these manifolds we define canonical equivariant fibrations onto complex flag
    manifolds. The simplest example is the Hopf fibration $S^3\to\mathbb{CP}^1$. In
    general these fibrations are not $CR$ submersions, however they satisfy a weaker
    condition that we introduce here, namely they are CR-deployments.

  abstract: We study CR quadrics satisfying a symmetry property $(\tilde S)$ which
    is slightly weaker than the symmetry property $(S)$, recently introduced by W.
    Kaup, which requires the existence of an automorphism reversing the gradation
    of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal automorphisms of the quadric. We characterize
    quadrics satisfying the $(\tilde S)$ property in terms of their Levi-Tanaka algebras.
    In many cases the $(\tilde S)$ property implies the $(S)$ property; this holds
    in particular for compact quadrics. We also give a new example of a quadric such
    that the dimension of the algebra of positive-degree infinitesimal automorphisms
    is larger than the dimension of the quadric.

  abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth locally embeddable CR manifold, having some CR dimension
    $m$ and some CR codimension $d$. We find an improved local geometric condition
    on $M$ which guarantees, at a point $p$ on $M$, that germs of CR distributions
    are smooth functions, and have extensions to germs of holomorphic functions on
    a full ambient neighborhood of $p$. Our condition is a form of weak pseudoconcavity,
    closely related to essential pseudoconcavity as introduced in [HN1], Applications
    are made to CR meromorphic functions and mappings. Explicit examples are given
    which satisfy our new condition, but which are not pseudoconcave in the strong
    sense. These results demonstrate that for codimension $d > 1$ there are additional
    phenomena, which are invisible when $d = 1$.

    by introducing their associated CR algebras. In particular, we give different
    notions of nondegeneracy (generalizing the usual notion for the Levi form) which
    correspond to geometrical properties for the corresponding manifolds. We also
    give distinguished equivariant CR fibrations for homogeneous CR manifolds. In
    the second part of the paper we apply these results to minimal orbits for the
    action of a real form of a semisimple Lie group $G$ on a flag manifold $G/Q$.

  abstract: Let $\^G$ be a complex semisimple Lie group, $Q$ a parabolic subgroup
    and $G$ a real form of $\^G$. The flag manifold $\^G/Q$ decomposes into finitely
    many $G$-orbits; among them there is exactly one orbit of minimal dimension, which
    is compact. We study these minimal orbits from the point of view of CR geometry.
    In particular we characterize those minimal orbits that are of finite type and
    satisfy various nondegeneracy conditions, compute their fundamental group and
    describe the space of their global CR functions. Our main tool are parabolic CR
    algebras, which give an infinitesimal description of the CR structure of minimal
    orbits.
